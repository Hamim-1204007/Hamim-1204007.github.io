👨🏻‍💻 I'm a $4^th$ year PhD student in Lyles School of Civil Engineering at Purdue University.

🔬 My research interests are in using network science and machine learning models to design a resilient and equitable infrastructure for electric vehicles!

📚 I'm currently working towards my PhD Thesis in the field of transportation engineering.

📽️ I am also interested in supervising and collobariting others in this domain.
